# FamCal - Organise your family life

FamCal (better name pending) is a web application that helps families organise their lives. It is a calendar that integrates with Google Calendar and allows families to create events, assign them to family members, and keep track of who is doing what.

Events can be created, edited, and deleted and will sync with Google Calendar. Any events created in Google Calendar will also be displayed in FamCal. Events can be assigned to one or more family members, and can be marked as complete. Events can be viewed in a calendar view, a list view, or a timeline view.
